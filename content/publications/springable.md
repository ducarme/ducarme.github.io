In recent years, nonlinearities in mechanical structures have shown great promise in providing solutions to embed advanced
functionalities in mechanical systems. However, designing structures subject to nonlinearities can be challenging due to
the complexity of their behavior. For example, nonlinearities can cause a structure to become unstable, buckle, snap and
reconfigure completely. While the traditional finite element analysis (FEA) is a great tool to simulate a specific nonlinear
structure quantitatively, it is often very cumbersome to use in the early stage of the design process where one often seeks
to quickly and easily explore many various design ideas, and gain insight into the nontrivial influence of certain design
parameters on the mechanical response. Moreover, the large number of degrees of freedom involved in traditional FEA hinder
the intuitive phenomenology, makes this approach computationally expensive, and unreliable when instabilities are involved.
In other words, despite the growing interest in harnessing nonlinearities and instabilities for functional devices, quick,
robust and intuitive design approaches are lacking.
In this work, we developed a tool to assist students, academics and engineers in gaining a better insight into nonlinearities,
instabilities and reconfigurations, and in designing these unconventional structures. It consists of an easy-to-use Python
library that allows to model simple or complex structures in just a few minutes and robustly simulate them in a matter of
seconds. The key idea consists of representing structures as assemblies of linear or nonlinear (longitudinal, rotational)
springs, thereby allowing to quickly solve, iterate and identify relevant parameters. We demonstrate how our approach can
help understand and design nonlinear structures through many concrete examples ranging from soft inflatable or wire-driven
actuators to metamaterials capable of complex snapping sequences. With this work, we envision eliminating a practical
barrier for the design of engineering systems that harness nonlinear mechanical behavior.
