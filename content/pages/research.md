Title: Research
Save_as: index.html

I'm a researcher interested in nonlinear mechanics and metamaterials! I seek a deeper understanding of the interplay between
geometry and elasticity in structures. In particular, I'm focusing on harnessing instabilities to embed complex behaviors
and functions in mechanical systems.

What structural design lead to a given functionality? Can we find
the building blocks to assemble to form a structure with a desired deformation path?
