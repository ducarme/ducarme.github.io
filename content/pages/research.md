I'm a researcher{% sidenote 'side-note-id' 'PhD candidate at AMOLF' %}
 interested in nonlinear mechanics and metamaterials
 <!-- {% marginnote 'margin-note-id' 'margin-note' %} -->
! I seek a deeper understanding of the interplay between
geometry and elasticity in structures. In particular, I'm focusing on harnessing instabilities to embed complex behaviors

and functions in mechanical systems.

{% newthought Start of new paragraph %} What structural design lead to a given functionality? Can we find
the building blocks to assemble to form a structure with a desired deformation path?

Here is a YT video

what do you think?

A new sound is something that really changes the way you look at the world and maybe decide your next career.
