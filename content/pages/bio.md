## PhD at AMOLF and ARCNL (Amsterdam, Netherlands)

## Master of Science at University of Liege (Belgium)
with focus on mechanical engineering. Magna Cum Laude

### Exchange with University of Ottawa (ON, Canada)
Focus: reinforcement learning, mechatronics

### Master project in collaboration with Safran in Liege, Belgium

Goal: re-design of the front bearing support of the jet engine, to reduce the number of parts and have a more integrated
design that can be 3d printed. A key challenge was to design the structure to fail for specific critical load cases,
which is ordinarily achieved with calibrated, machined bolt. Since 3d printing does not permit high part accuracy, my group and I
designed a system of integrated beams able to suddenly buckle and fail under the specific loading conditions.

### Master thesis at company, AnyShape in Liege, Belgium

Goal: determining the printing parameters of the selective laser melting technique to optimize speed while ensuring
sufficient part quality. I experimentally identified regions in the parameter space where keyhole instabilities,
Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities or insufficient powder particle fusion where taking place and affecting quality
due to poor density, thereby delimiting a suitable window of printing parameters.

### Student job at Aerosint in Liege, Belgium
Goal: designing and building a machine to stretch Teflon tubes.

## Bachelor of Science at University of Liege (Belgium)
general engineering with focus on physics, quantum mechanics, mechanical engineering, OOP programming. Cum Laude

## Hobby's
chess, biking, photography, indoor football, bouldering
